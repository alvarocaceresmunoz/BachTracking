# 3. Midi input

Tired of typing notes with your computer keyboard? No problem! You can write them with your MIDI keyboard!

Make BachTraking listen to your keyboard by pressing `Ctrl-L` (from **L**listening). When you are done, press `Ctrl-shift-L`. The notes will be written in your text editor, automatically!

Beware! You won't get any note duration when using MIDI input; only pitch and octave. You have to write durations yourself.
